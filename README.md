# Data-Driven Insights on Mortality Trends in the U.S.

A Python-based data analysis project exploring weekly death counts in the U.S., categorized by causes such as COVID-19, heart disease, cancer, and more. This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing real-world mortality data to reveal meaningful patterns and trends using visual storytelling techniques.


# Project Overview

This analysis leverages publicly available datasets to understand mortality trends across the United States, focusing on:

- Cause-specific death rates (COVID-19, heart disease, cancer, etc.)
- State-wise impact and jurisdictional comparisons
- Temporal trends from 2020 to 2021
- Identification of vulnerable populations

Through insightful visualizations and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project delivers actionable insights into one of the most crucial public health topics.

# Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis

---

# Dataset

The dataset used contains weekly provisional counts of deaths by select causes and jurisdiction in the U.S.  
**Source**: [CDC National Center for Health Statistics](https://data.cdc.gov/)

---

# Key Visualizations

- **Stacked Area Charts** – To compare death trends over time
- **Heatmaps** – To analyze intensity by state and cause
- **Pie Charts** – To show percentage distribution of deaths by cause
- **Correlation Matrices** – To identify statistical relationships between variables

---

# Insights & Findings

- COVID-19 mortality spiked significantly during 2020–2021.
- Heart disease remains a consistently leading cause of death.
- Certain states were disproportionately affected across various causes.
- Visualizations help highlight how public health crises evolve over time.

# What I Learned

- Advanced data wrangling with Pandas
- Effective visual storytelling techniques
- Handling missing/incomplete data
- Crafting insights from complex real-world datasets
